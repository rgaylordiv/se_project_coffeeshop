# <h1>Hello, my name is Roger Gaylord and my project is named se_project_coffeeshop</h1>
## <h2>While working on this I used my knowledge of learning how to sort headers, create iframe properties, organize a form, help with my mastery of flexbox, use animation for the first time on a project, and a footer.</h2>
### <h3>I think what I would improve is giving the webpage a little more character and animations to make it more eye ppopping than it already is. I think what I need to improve on is my use of flexboxes, margins, and padding. Being set to figure out the animation for the circle with not as descript detail as the rest of the project was at first daunting but ultimately rewarding when it began working.
